# AudioClassification
Using Neural Network models to try to predict the emotions expressed by the actors in audio files. More specifically, we will make use of a Convolutional Neural Network and compare its effectiveness on this task with that of a Recurrent Neural Network, namely a Long Short-Term Memory network.
